# MAT 236 Computational Systems for Visual Art and Design

This is an organization for the Fall 25' class on computational systems for visual art and design.

## Getting Started
1. Once you receive an invite, create a new repository on this GitHub organization. 
Use your first name (no spaces) as the repository name. Do not initialize a README, add a gitignore, or a license.

2. Open the [student_sample repository](https://github.com/CSVADFall25/studentsamplefolder) in the organization. This is a template I've created to help you set up your own repository. 

2. Download a zipped copy of the repository to your computer, unzip it, and save it somewhere that is not your Downloads folder. You might also want to rename the directory.

3. Open the README.md file and edit it with your personal information.

4. Open the command-line application on your computer (Terminal on Mac and Linux, Command Prompt on Windows) and cd into the directory.

5. Initialize a git repository and add your files:  
`git init`  
`git add --all`
   
7. Make your first commit:  
`git commit -m "your message here"`

8. Setup your remote to point to the repository you created with your name and push your changes to the remote:  
`git branch -M main`  
`git remote add origin https://github.com/CSVADFall25/<my folder name>.git`  
`git push -u origin main`
